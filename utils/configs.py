Your task is to analyze a list of words with their associated indices in the beta matrix.

For each topic:
1. Identify the main topic that most of the words are related to.  
2. Describe that topic briefly in a few English words.  
3. Return only one JSON object in the following format:

{
  "k": <topic_index>,
  "topic": "<short English description>",
  "w_plus_indices": [<beta_indices of words related to the main topic>],
  "w_minus_indices": [<beta_indices of words not related to the main topic>]
}

Notes:
- Use the beta matrix indices provided with each word, not the position in the list.
- "w_plus_indices" should contain beta indices of words that are coherent with the main topic.  
- "w_minus_indices" should contain beta indices of words that are unrelated or noisy.  
- Do not include explanations, only output the JSON object.
